## Functions
- Application allows the user to choose a date and time range for listing all events during that period.
- Application allows the user to choose calendars (a single user may have several Google calendars, one of which is the 'primary' calendar) and list 'blocking'  (non-transparent) appointments between a start date and an end date for some subset of them.
- Users can mark their busy time as free so they can get a list of free time to meeting!
## Test
nosetests is ready for testing but it only works for a specified calendar (my calendar actually)
